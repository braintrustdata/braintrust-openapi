      description: >-
        limit the number of traces fetched


        Fetch queries may be paginated if the total result size is expected to be large (e.g. project_logs which accumulate over a long time). Note that fetch queries only support pagination in descending time order (from latest to earliest `_xact_id`. Furthermore, later pages may return rows which showed up in earlier pages, except with an earlier `_xact_id`. This happens because pagination occurs over the whole version history of the event log. You will most likely want to exclude any such duplicate, outdated rows (by `id`) from your combined result set.


        The `limit` parameter controls the number of full traces to return. So you may end up with more individual rows than the specified limit if you are fetching events containing traces.
    StartingAfter:
      type: string

        For example, if the final item in the last page you fetched had an id of `foo`, pass `starting_after=foo` to fetch the next page. Note: you may only pass one of `starting_after` and `ending_before`
    EndingBefore:
      type: string
      format: uuid
      description: >-

        For example, if the initial item in the last page you fetched had an id of `foo`, pass `ending_before=foo` to fetch the previous page. Note: you may only pass one of `starting_after` and `ending_before`

        DEPRECATION NOTICE: The manually-constructed pagination cursor is

        requests. Please prefer the 'cursor' argument going forwards.


        Together, `max_xact_id` and `max_root_span_id` form a pagination cursor


        Since a paginated fetch query returns results in order from latest to earliest, the cursor for the next page can be found as the row with the minimum (earliest) value of the tuple `(_xact_id, root_span_id)`. See the documentation of `limit` for an overview of paginating fetch queries.

            failures. For example, a summarization app might have one score that
            tells you how accurate the summary is, and another that measures the
            word similarity between the generated and grouth truth summary. The
            word similarity score could help you determine whether the
            summarization was covering similar concepts or not. You can use

            The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any
            existing row with the same id in the DB. By default (or when set to
            `false`), the existing row is completely replaced by the new row.
            When set to `true`, the new row is deep-merged into the existing row


            For example, say there is an existing row in the DB `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`. If we replace the new row as `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`

            Tracking hierarchical relationships are important for tracing (see
            the [guide](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/guides/tracing) for full
            details).


            For example, say we have logged a row `{"id": "abc", "input": "foo", "output": "bar", "expected": "boo", "scores": {"correctness": 0.33}}`. We can create a sub-span of the parent row by logging `{"_parent_id": "abc", "id": "llm_call", "input": {"prompt": "What comes after foo?"}, "output": "bar", "metrics": {"tokens": 1}}`. In the webapp, only the root span row `"abc"` will show up in the summary view. You can view the full trace hierarchy (in this case, the `"llm_call"` row) by clicking on the "abc" row.

            The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any
            existing row with the same id in the DB. By default (or when set to
            `false`), the existing row is completely replaced by the new row.
            When set to `true`, the new row is deep-merged into the existing row


            For example, say there is an existing row in the DB `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`. If we replace the new row as `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`

            The `_merge_paths` field allows controlling the depth of the merge.
            It can only be specified alongside `_is_merge=true`. `_merge_paths`
            is a list of paths, where each path is a list of field names. The
            deep merge will not descend below any of the specified merge paths.


            For example, say there is an existing row in the DB `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": {"b": 10}, "c": {"d": 20}}, "output": {"a": 20}}`. If we merge a new row as `{"_is_merge": true, "_merge_paths": [["input", "a"], ["output"]], "input": {"a": {"q": 30}, "c": {"e": 30}, "bar": "baz"}, "output": {"d": 40}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo": "input": {"a": {"q": 30}, "c": {"d": 20, "e": 30}, "bar": "baz"}, "output": {"d": 40}}`. In this case, due to the merge paths, we have replaced `input.a` and `output`, but have still deep-merged `input` and `input.c`.

Furthermore, later pages may return rows which showed up in earlier pages, except with an earlier `_xact_id`. This happens because pagination occurs over the whole version history of the event log. You will most likely want to exclude any such duplicate, outdated rows (by `id`) from your combined result set.


            The `limit` parameter controls the number of full traces to return. So you may end up with more individual rows than the specified limit if you are fetching events containing traces.

            Together, `max_xact_id` and `max_root_span_id` form a pagination cursor


            Since a paginated fetch query returns results in order from latest to earliest, the cursor for the next page can be found as the row with the minimum (earliest) value of the tuple `(_xact_id, root_span_id)`. See the documentation of `limit` for an overview of paginating fetch queries.

            The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any
            existing row with the same id in the DB. By default (or when set to
            `false`), the existing row is completely replaced by the new row.
            When set to `true`, the new row is deep-merged into the existing row


            For example, say there is an existing row in the DB `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`. If we replace the new row as `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`

            Tracking hierarchical relationships are important for tracing (see
            the [guide](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/guides/tracing) for full
            details).


            For example, say we have logged a row `{"id": "abc", "input": "foo", "output": "bar", "expected": "boo", "scores": {"correctness": 0.33}}`. We can create a sub-span of the parent row by logging `{"_parent_id": "abc", "id": "llm_call", "input": {"prompt": "What comes after foo?"}, "output": "bar", "metrics": {"tokens": 1}}`. In the webapp, only the root span row `"abc"` will show up in the summary view. You can view the full trace hierarchy (in this case, the `"llm_call"` row) by clicking on the "abc" row.

In this case, due to the merge paths, we have replaced `input.a` and `output`, but have still deep-merged `input` and `input.c`.

            The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any
            existing row with the same id in the DB. By default (or when set to
            `false`), the existing row is completely replaced by the new row.
            When set to `true`, the new row is deep-merged into the existing row


            For example, say there is an existing row in the DB `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`.

            Tracking hierarchical relationships are important for tracing (see
            the [guide](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/guides/tracing) for full
            details).


            For example, say we have logged a row `{"id": "abc", "input": "foo", "output": "bar", "expected": "boo", "scores": {"correctness": 0.33}}`. We can create a sub-span of the parent row by logging `{"_parent_id": "abc", "id": "llm_call", "input": {"prompt": "What comes after foo?"}, "output": "bar", "metrics": {"tokens": 1}}`. In the webapp, only the root span row `"abc"` will show up in the summary view. You can view the full trace hierarchy (in this case, the `"llm_call"` row) by clicking on the "abc" row.

            is a list of paths, where each path is a list of field names. The
            deep merge will not descend below any of the specified merge paths.


            For example, say there is an existing row in the DB `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": {"b": 10}, "c": {"d": 20}}, "output": {"a": 20}}`. If we merge a new row as `{"_is_merge": true, "_merge_paths": [["input", "a"], ["output"]], "input": {"a": {"q": 30}, "c": {"e": 30}, "bar": "baz"}, "output": {"d": 40}}`, the new row will be `{"id": "foo": "input": {"a": {"q": 30}, "c": {"d": 20, "e": 30}, "bar": "baz"}, "output": {"d": 40}}`. In this case, due to the merge paths, we have replaced `input.a` and `output`, but have still deep-merged `input` and `input.c`.

        Fetch queries may be paginated if the total result size is expected to be large (e.g. project_logs which accumulate over a long time). Note that fetch queries only support pagination in descending time order (from latest to earliest `_xact_id`. Furthermore, later pages may return rows which showed up in earlier pages, except with an earlier `_xact_id`. This happens because pagination occurs over the whole version history of the event log. You will most likely want to exclude any such duplicate, outdated rows (by `id`) from your combined result set.


        The `limit` parameter controls the number of full traces to return. So you may end up with more individual rows than the specified limit if you are fetching events containing traces.
